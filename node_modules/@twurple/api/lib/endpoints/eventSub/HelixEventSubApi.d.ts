 * The API methods that deal with EventSub.
 *
 * Can be accessed using `client.eventSub` on an {@link ApiClient} instance.
 *
 * ## Before using these methods...
 *
 * All methods in this class assume that you are already running a working EventSub listener reachable using the given transport.
 *
 * If you don't already have one, we recommend use of the `@twurple/eventsub-http` or `@twurple/eventsub-ws` libraries,
 * which handle subscribing and unsubscribing to these topics automatically.
 *
 * ## Example
 * ```ts
 * const api = new ApiClient({ authProvider });
 * await api.eventSub.subscribeToUserFollowsTo('125328655', { callbackUrl: 'https://example.com' });
 * ```
 *
